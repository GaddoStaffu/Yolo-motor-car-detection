# Enable data augmentation to balance motorcycle instances
augment: True
mosaic: 2.0 # Even stronger blending to make motorcycles appear more
mixup: 0.6 # More blending of motorcycles

# Color Augmentations
hsv_h: 0.02
hsv_s: 0.8
hsv_v: 0.5

# Geometric Augmentations (More aggressive for motorcycles)
flipud: 0.5
fliplr: 0.9 # Flip motorcycles more often
scale: 0.9 # Slightly larger scaling
shear: 20.0 # Increase shear for motorcycle variations
translate: 0.4 # More shifting to make motorcycles appear in different places

# Blur & Noise (Minimal, to avoid degrading image quality)
blur: 0.05
noise: 0.02

# Occlusion Augmentations (Simulating real-world obstructions)
cutout: 0.5 # Even more aggressive occlusions for motorcycles

# Auto Weighting (Increase Augmentations Only for Motorcycle)
class_weights:
  - 3.0 # Increase bike weighting (car remains at 1.0)
  - 1.0 # Car remains normal
