# YOLOv8 Car and Motorcycle Detection

This project utilizes **YOLOv8** to detect cars and motorcycles using the **N_O_2 Computer Vision Project** dataset from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/nada-majd-e4uhb/n_o_2). The model is trained to recognize and differentiate between vehicles, making it useful for traffic monitoring, smart surveillance, and autonomous driving applications.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time detection** of cars and motorcycles using YOLOv8
- **Pre-trained and fine-tuned model** on the N_O_2 dataset
- **High accuracy and efficiency** using Ultralytics' YOLOv8
- **Supports video and image inference**
- **Easy deployment** with Python and OpenCV

## üìÇ Dataset

The project is trained on the **N_O_2 Computer Vision Project** dataset, which consists of labeled images of cars and motorcycles in various conditions. The dataset can be accessed from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/nada-majd-e4uhb/n_o_2).
